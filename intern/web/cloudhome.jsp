        <p>Cloud computing is a type of computing that relies on shared computing resources
            rather than having local servers or personal devices to handle applications.</p>
        <h1>Characters </h1>
        <p>true cloud environments have five key characteristics:</p>
        <h3>On-demand self-service</h3>
        <p>This means that cloud customers can sign up for, pay for and start using cloud resources very 
            quickly on their own without help from a sales agent.</p>
        <br/>

        <h3>Broad network access</h3>
        <p>Customers access cloud services via the Internet.</p>
        <br/>
        <h3>Resource pooling</h3>
        <p>Many different customers  all use the same servers, storage or other computing resources.</p>
        <h3>Rapid elasticity or expansion</h3>
        <p>Cloud customers can easily scale their use of resources up or down as their needs change.</p>
        <h3>Measured service</h3>
        <p>Customers pay for the amount of resources they use in a given period of time rather than paying for 
            hardware or software upfront.</p>
