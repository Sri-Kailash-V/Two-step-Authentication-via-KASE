        <h1><img src="img/trimg2.jpg" alt="trimg2.jpg" class="img2"/>What Is A Trustee?</h1>
        <p>A trustee is an entity or person formally appointed to manage the assets of a trust for the benefit of its 
            beneficiaries in accordance with the terms of the trust. A trustee owes fiduciary duties to the beneficiaries.
            These duties are typically set out in the trust deed or provided by Statute.</p>

        <h1>Responsiblity </h1>
        <h3>Duty to the terms</h3>
        <p>A trustee must know and adhere to the terms of the trust which are prescribed by the trust deed.</p>
        <br/>
        <img src="img/trimg1.jpg" alt="trimg1.jpg" class="img2" style="float: left;"/><h3>Duty of loyalty</h3>
        <p>Trustees have a fiduciary duty towards beneficiaries. A trustee must administer the trust solely in
            the interest of the trust beneficiaries and cannot place his or her interest in conflict with 
            beneficiaries.  Trustees should not profit personally from their role as trustees other than a fee
            which they may receive for their trusteeship.</p>
        <br/>
        <h3>Duty to manage the trust efficiently</h3>
        <p>To manage a trust efficiently, a trustee must be very familiar with the terms of the trust, 
            the trustâ€™s assets and liabilities, the circumstances of the beneficiaries and the purpose of
            the trust. Effective management systems should be in place to ensure that the appropriate decisions 
            are made in a timely manner and taking into account the terms of the trust and the interests of the
            beneficiaries. </p>
