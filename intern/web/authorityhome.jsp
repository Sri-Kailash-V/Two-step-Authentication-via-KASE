        <p>A leader who balances authority and responsibility throughout the organization will experience great satisfaction.
        </p>
        <p>Authority is the power to decide and act; as well as to direct the decisions and actions of others. 
            The scope and impact of a leaderâ€™s organizational decisions and actions profoundly impact every stakeholder.

        <h3> Act from instruction</h3>
        <p>At this level the individual implements decisions made by others.  There is no choice.
        </p>
        <h3>Act after approval</h3>
        <p> The person weighs factors and acts only after their manager approves.</p>
        <h3>Decide, inform and act</h3>
        <p> Power to decide is added, but people remain accountable to someone else.</p>
        <h3>Decide and act</h3>
        <p> Provides complete authority.
