# Two-step-Authentication-via-KASE

In a KASE scheme the owner only needs to distribute a “single key to a user when
sharing a variety of documents with the user and the user only needs to enter key and submit”.
In order to reduce the number of user interaction on files stored in cloud, the access of file is
been separated with two higher personals namely trustee and authority which is provided under
multi owners setting. Such that users will interact with trustee upon granting the request user
is made available to request for key that decrypts the file.
There by the unauthorised access of files can be reduced by using this technique.
